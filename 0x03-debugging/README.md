## Debugging
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in computer programs. It is an important part of the software development process, as it helps to identify problems and come up with solutions to them. When a program contains errors, i 
can produce incorrect results or crash altogether. Debugging involves systematically identifying and isolating these errors, and then making the necessary changes to the code to fix them. This process can be time-consuming, but it is essential for ensuring that a program is reliable and works as intended.

## Manual Debugging methods
- Use of print statement
  By strategically placing print statements throughout your code, you can track   the flow of execution and identify where errors are occurring.
- Use of a debugger
- Test cases. 

In addition to these tools, it can also be helpful to think logically about the problem and come up with a hypothesis about where the error might be occurring. Then, you can test your hypothesis by making changes to the code and observing the results.

## How to read an error message
To read an error message in C, start by looking at the first line of the message. This will usually include the name of the source file where the error occurred, along with the line number and the specific line of code where the error was detected. This information can be helpful for locating the error in your code.

Next, look at the second line of the message, which will typically include the actual error message itself. This message will describe the nature of the error, such as a syntax error or a type mismatch. It may also include additional details, such as the name of the function or variable that caused the error.

Finally, look at any additional lines of the error message, which may provide more information about the error and possible ways to fix it. These lines may include suggestions for fixing the error, or additional context about what went wrong.

Overall, reading error messages in C can be challenging, but it is an important skill for anyone who is learning to program in this language. By carefully reading and understanding error messages, you can learn from your mistakes and improve your coding skills.
